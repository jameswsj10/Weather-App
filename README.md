# Weather-App

### iOS Weather App

After learning more about API calls, encoding decoding schemes, we developed a weather app using the Dark Sky API to display information about the weather conditions and forecast. This application reports weather conditions for any location at any time that the user specifies into the options page. It also pinpoints the user's location and provides conditions based on his or her coordinates and time. Exercising all of the basics of iOS devleopment I've learned the past few weeks, I've been able to create seamless transition weather app with simple, yet effective design based upon a figma sketch. I've also implemented an additional feature where we grab the forecast of today's weather from online and lets users press a button to hear today's weather forecast.
